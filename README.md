# When does Pooled Sampling Save Money?
In this document, I store the code created to simulate the data and analysis of the data done for the Kansas State University Spring Mathematical Modelling Seminar 2023. In this seminar talk, I introduced how mathematical modelling can be used to test COVID-19 testing strategies with consideration of limited logistical and finanical resources. I introduced the idea/orgins of pooled sampling and lead the discussion to reveal a key variable that affects the efficiency of the pooled-sampling strategy is the incidence of the disease. So, we wanted to discover the relationship between the incidence of COVID-19 and the average number of tests each pooled sample required. This will allow key decision makers to make better decisions on key testing strategies. For more details, please read my paper at:
